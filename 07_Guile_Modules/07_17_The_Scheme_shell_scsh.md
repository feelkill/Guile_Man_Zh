7.17 The Scheme shell (scsh)
============================

An incomplete port of the Scheme shell (scsh) was once available for
Guile as a separate package.  However this code has bitrotten somewhat.
The pieces are available in Guileâ€™s legacy CVS repository, which may be
browsed at
<http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/guile/guile-scsh/?root=guile>.

   For information about scsh see <http://www.scsh.net/>.

   This bitrotting is a bit of a shame, as there is a good deal of
well-written Scheme code in scsh.  Adopting this code and porting it to
current Guile should be an educational experience, in addition to
providing something of value to Guile folks.
