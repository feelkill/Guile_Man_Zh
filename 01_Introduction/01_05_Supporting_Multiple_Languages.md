1.5 Supporting Multiple Languages
=================================

Since the 2.0 release, Guile’s architecture supports compiling any
language to its core virtual machine bytecode, and Scheme is just one of
the supported languages.  Other supported languages are Emacs Lisp,
ECMAScript (commonly known as Javascript) and Brainfuck, and work is
under discussion for Lua, Ruby and Python.

   This means that users can program applications which use Guile in the
language of their choice, rather than having the tastes of the
application’s author imposed on them.
