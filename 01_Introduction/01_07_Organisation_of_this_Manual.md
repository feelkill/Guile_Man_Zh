1.7 Organisation of this Manual
===============================

The rest of this manual is organised into the following chapters.

*Chapter 2: Hello Guile!*
     A whirlwind tour shows how Guile can be used interactively and as a
     script interpreter, how to link Guile into your own applications,
     and how to write modules of interpreted and compiled code for use
     with Guile.  Everything introduced here is documented again and in
     full by the later parts of the manual.

*Chapter 3: Hello Scheme!*
     For readers new to Scheme, this chapter provides an introduction to
     the basic ideas of the Scheme language.  This material would apply
     to any Scheme implementation and so does not make reference to
     anything Guile-specific.

*Chapter 4: Programming in Scheme*
     Provides an overview of programming in Scheme with Guile.  It
     covers how to invoke the ‘guile’ program from the command-line and
     how to write scripts in Scheme.  It also introduces the extensions
     that Guile offers beyond standard Scheme.

*Chapter 5: Programming in C*
     Provides an overview of how to use Guile in a C program.  It
     discusses the fundamental concepts that you need to understand to
     access the features of Guile, such as dynamic types and the garbage
     collector.  It explains in a tutorial like manner how to define new
     data types and functions for the use by Scheme programs.

*Chapter 6: Guile API Reference*
     This part of the manual documents the Guile API in
     functionality-based groups with the Scheme and C interfaces
     presented side by side.

*Chapter 7: Guile Modules*
     Describes some important modules, distributed as part of the Guile
     distribution, that extend the functionality provided by the Guile
     Scheme core.

*Chapter 8: GOOPS*
     Describes GOOPS, an object oriented extension to Guile that
     provides classes, multiple inheritance and generic functions.
