# 1 简介

<!--
Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language.  Scheme
(<http://schemers.org/>) is an elegant and conceptually simple dialect
of Lisp, originated by Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman, and since evolved
by the series of reports known as RnRS (the Revised^n Reports on
Scheme).

Guile是Scheme编程语言的一种实现。Scheme(<http://schemers.org/>)的创始人是Guy Steele和Gerald Sussman，之后经一系列的RnRS修订 (the Revisied^n Reports on Scheme)进行演进。从概念上来讲，Scheme是Lisp的一个优雅而简单的方言。

<!--
   Unlike, for example, Python or Perl, Scheme has no benevolent
dictator.  There are many Scheme implementations, with different
characteristics and with communities and academic activities around
them, and the language develops as a result of the interplay between
these.  Guile’s particular characteristics are that

与Python或Perl不同，Scheme并不是一家独大的。它有多种实现，这些实现各有特征，不同的社区和学术活动其中。所以，Scheme的发展深受这些因素的影响，是它们相互作用的产物。Guile的独特特性有：

<!--
   • it is easy to combine with other code written in C
   • it has a historical and continuing connection with the GNU Project
   • it emphasizes interactive and incremental programming
   • it actually supports several languages, not just Scheme.

  * 易于跟c写的其他代码结合

  * 与GUN项目有着历史性的、连续性的连接

  * 强调交互编程和增量编程

  * 支持多种语言，而不仅仅Scheme

<!--
The next few sections explain what we mean by these points.  The
sections after that cover how you can obtain and install Guile, and the
typographical conventions that we use in this manual.

接下来，我们花少量几节阐述所说的这几个要点。然后，告诉你如何获得并安装Guile，以及我们在此手册中所使用的印刷协定。
